	make clean
	
3. To install NumaTOP (needs root authority).
	make install


Build Dependencies
------------------
NumaTOP requires following libraries:

1. numactl-devel or libnuma-dev(el)
2. libncurses
3. libpthread


Kernel Requirement:
------------------
NumaTOP requires a special patch which supports PEBS Load Latency functionality.
The patch has not been integrated in 3.8 (probably it will be integrated
in 3.9). The following steps instruct how to get and apply the patch.

1. git clone git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/tip/tip.git
2. cd tip
3. git checkout perf/x86
4. build kernel as usual


Directories
------------------
common:	common code for all platforms.

intel : Intel platform-specific code.

test  : mgen source code. mgen is a micro-test application which can
        generate memory access with runtime latency value among CPUs.
        Note that this application is only used for numatop testing!

Note:
-----
numatop is supported on Intel Xeon processors: 5500-series, 6500/7500-series,
5600 series, E7-x8xx-series, and E5-16xx/24xx/26xx/46xx-series. 

E5-16xx/24xx/26xx/46xx-series had better be updated to latest CPU microcode
(microcode must be 0x618+ or 0x70c+).
