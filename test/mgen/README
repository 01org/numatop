Building
---------
1. To build mgen
	make

2. To clean the built objects
	make clean

Note
----
mgen is a micro-test application which can generate memory access with
runtime latency between CPUs. 

Please note the latencies reported by mgen are not the official latencies
from Intel. It is just a tool to test numatop.

For example:

1. Generate LMA (Local Memory Access) on cpu1 for running 1000s:
   ./mgen -a 1 -c 1 -t 1000

2. Generate RMA (Remote Memory Access) from cpu10 to cpu0 for running 1000s.
   (cpu10 and cpu0 are on different nodes):
   ./mgen -a 0 -c 10 -t 1000
